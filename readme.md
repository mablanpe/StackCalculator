## How to work on this project

Note that the build is managed using FAKE, so .sln file is dummy.
You are free to use any text editor to work with the source base, 
I personally use Visual Studio Code (just open main directory with Code).

## Build

    Run build.cmd
    
## Run

Cannot be run, it is run with tests project

## Run Tests

After building,

    Run build.cmd RunTests
